## Python - Test-driven development

> Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming,
> specific to the Python programming language:
> classes, ```__del__```, ```__repr__```, @classmethods, @staticmethods

### Description of what each file shows

* main_files ----- folder holds main programs that showcase examples of how to use functions
* Files that start with:
0. define empty Rectangle class to use as a basis for all other files
1. add private width and height attributes with @property getter and setter
2. add public methods area and perimeter
3. add string representation for print() and (str) to work
4. add string representation for repr() and eval() to work
5. add __del__ method
6. create and update class attribute number_of_instances
7. create attribute that allows for printing rectangle based on what's given
8. create static method that compares rectangle areas
9. create class method that returns new rectangle instance as a square
